# Usage
Using this mod is very simple! Use **/pokewand** to obtain a wand item. Right clicking a target with that wand will cause your nearby pokemon to target that mob!

# Details
Every pokemon type has its own attack! Many attacks are split into ranged vs physical based on the Pokemon's stats.

All damage is (mostly) battle accurate! Some niche factors like abilities may not always be included, but in normal situations, you can expect the damage to be accurate.

Your pokemon will receive rewards for knocking out pokemon! The normal exp, EVs, and items will drop after the target pokemon is defeated.
